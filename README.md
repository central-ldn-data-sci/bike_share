Consulting-y Style Problem: Based on this data, recommend where to open the next bike share station to maximize ridership

Potential Appraoches:
- Use Tableau to explore the data and come up with your method
- Write a program to automate this

Bonus:
- Is ridership the "right" metric to optimize for? What happens if you optimize for one of these instead? How does your recommendation change?
** TFL Profit
** Fewest Accidents 
** Most People on Public Transit Generally (advanced, as you would probably want to use the other TFL Data to try this one). 
- Build an automated solution to this this so that the recommender is live and active (this may require ££ to host, so a script is just fine)

Disclaimer: This description (and repo) was updated quite a while after the actual meetup, so it's looking a little empty. Please feel free to contribute a solution if you have one :)
